# Book, youtube , video courses to learn about Python.

THe downloaded code I keep in PUB\03_src\LIBS\

From there I copy all or a part into the directories here. Each directory is a course (book). Within the directories I sepearte the original code file from the files I create by leaving them in a sub-directory.

The text or vidoe belonging to the coures I reference in the .md file. 
 
 Books - I try to keep in calibre, kindle or as .pdf file in /PUB-Bilbio/
 Articles - 
 Videos - I keep the reference.
