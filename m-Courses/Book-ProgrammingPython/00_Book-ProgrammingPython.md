# Book Programming Python Examples

The book comes with an example.zip file. I downloaded it and stored it in
>Ref: \03_src\LIBS\Python\Book-ProgrammingPython_MarkLutz\PP4E-Examples-1.4.zip

Zip file contains other files and folders (changes, extensions), but I copied only the content of 

PUB\03_src\LIBS\Python\Book-ProgrammingPython_MarkLutz\PP4E-Examples-1.4.zip\PP4E-Examples-1.4\Examples

into this directory.
