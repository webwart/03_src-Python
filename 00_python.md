# Python working environmet and code samples

This is the top-directory of my python code learning area. The first 4 month of 2020 I want to progress to the next level of python programming and machine learning.

## Goals

1. Define a working environment, where I can use python code on Win10 and uberspace.
2. Experiment with Djangon and Flask framework
3. Experiment with Machine Learning, algrorithm, and data structures
4. Experiment with python modules

## Set-up

- python system-wide , in subfolders I might use different einvironements.
- use Git with [remote repository](https://github.com/webwart/03_src-Python) , keepass r.w at hm.ch - N56 - Gi
- I FSY  between Sion-Desk and A500GbSaT3, but not with Naples-Lab

## Getting started

- make sure all files are updated. FSY to github. 
- open directory with VScode.
- select/verify python interpreter.
- select debug environment.
- when finished FSY with github
- Sion-Desk: FSY to A500GbSaT3
- Naples-Lab: Do not FSY !

>N: Add file header to .py files. Clean out and actualization of files.

## Structure and procedures

Restart of phyton directory

### SAT  21-02-2020

-1- Git¦
On github I created the repository 03_src-Python. Then I cloned this directory into PBU\03_src\python on Naples. I added some first files and did add them to the repository with git-bash cli.

### SUN  22-02-2020

-1-  Clean-out
\pandas\ , \SphinxTest\

### THU  27-02-2020

-1-  Sion-Desk¦Git
I created a new \python\ using the git pull on Sion-Desk.

-2-  Naples-Desk¦FSY
I removed \python\ from FSY with A500GbSaT3.

###  FRI  28-02-2020

-1-  Clean-out
Moved files from python-NoGit to python. Removed directories and files, which were no more relevant. 

-2-  Reevalution¦new Header
I added my new header for code files.
I go throught the files update them and evaluate how to organize them in the future.
>N: ExbXmlToCSV.py --OKAY--

###  MON  02-03-2020

-1- Python system wide
I added python 3.7 to Sion-Desk. I can use py launcher to switch between 3.7 and 3.8 on the command line. VScode does also recognize the 3.7.
I learned to update python with patches and add new minor versions.

-2- Reevalutaion¦new Header
Advanced further and delete some files.
