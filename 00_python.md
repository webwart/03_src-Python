# Python working environmet and code samples

This is the top-directory of my python code learning area. The first 4 month of 2020 I want to progress to the next level of python programming and machine learning.

## Goals

- Define a working environment, where I can use python code on Win10 and uberspace.
- Experiment with Djangon and Flask framework
- Experiment with Machine Learning , algrorithm , and data structures
- Experiment with python modules

## Set-up

- python system-wide , in subfolders might use different einvironements.
- use Git with [remote repository](https://github.com/webwart/03_src-Python) , keepass r.w at hm.ch - N56 - Gi
- sync between Naples-Lab and Sion-Desk.

## Getting started

- Make sure all files are updated.Sync with GIT or FFileSync.
- open directory with VScode.
- select/verify python interpreter.
- select debug environment.

## Structure and procedures
